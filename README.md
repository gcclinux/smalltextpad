# smalltextpad
SmallTextPad is a Simple Java Text Editor and 100% FREE Application, it was written in Java and therefore requires a minimum of JRE 11 installed on your System unless you installed snap or flatpak, SmallTextPad has several features already and is still being developed in my spare time.
