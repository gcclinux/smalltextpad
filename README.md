SmallTextPad with Encryption and multi-language

SmallTextPad is a Simple Java Text Editor and 100% FREE Application, it was written in Java and therefore requires a minimum of JRE 11 installed on your System unless you compile it and package it in snap or flatpak, SmallTextPad has several features already and is still being developed in my spare time.

If Java is not installed it can be downloaded from available opensource online.
